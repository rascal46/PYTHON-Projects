All necessary libraries are imported.


Beginning:

<UDF Record>

pyautogui takes the screen size.

this is then transferred to width and height variables

fourcc decides video file format. these are XVID,MP4V,etc. The '*' divides it into 4 separate characters.

an object (empty video file) called 'out' is created. 


A for loop is created. it will run for (frame_rate x duration). this decides the number of frames.

within one loop:

	pyautogui takes a screenshot.

	the ss is conerted to numpy array.

	for cv to work on it, it is converted from RGB to BGR.

	The now proccessed ss is added to object out.



if __name__ == "__main__": 

This ensures that the script only runs when executed directly (not when imported into another script).
Whenever you run a Python script, Python sets a special variable called __name__. If you run
the script directly → __name__ becomes "__main__". If the script is imported → __name__ becomes the name of the file instead of "__main__".


filename is entered and concated with '.mp4'

the FPS is set to 20

duration of choice is entered

the record udf is called.

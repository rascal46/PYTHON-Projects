I wanted to create a number guessing game using python. The rules will be simple.

	1. the user has 6 attempts.

	2. the user guesses a number. 

	3. if the number is higher than the answer:

		A.it displays "Too High" if the difference between the number and the answer exceeds 10

		B.it prompts the user to try a little lower if the said difference is lesser than or equal to 10


	4.if the number is lower than the answer:

		A.it displays "Too Low" if the difference between the number and the answer exceeds 10

		B.it prompts the user to try a little higher if the said difference is lesser than or equal to 10
